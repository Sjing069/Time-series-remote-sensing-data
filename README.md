There are two sets of time seires images, named "Jiamusi" and "Kunshan".
In "Jiamusi"ï¼Œthere are three small experimental areas (256x256 pixels) from 2015 to 2016, named "J1", "J2" and "J3" respectively.
"Kunshan" covers 1005x937 pixels from 1991 to 2010.
Each subfolder has a set of original multispectral images and corresponding label data.
All images comes from Landsat sensor. For more detailed data description, please refer to the paper--<Shen, Jing, et al. "Semi-supervised convolutional long short-term memory neural networks for time series land cover classification." Remote Sensing 13.17 (2021): 3504.>.
